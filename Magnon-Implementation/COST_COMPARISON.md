## Return on Investment

|---------|--------|---------|
| **Positive result** | High-profile Nature paper | High-profile paper + rapid follow-up |
| | Technology development possible | Low-cost replication by others |

| **Null result** | $2M spent, constraints published | $200K spent, constraints published |
| | Limited follow-up possible | Easy to try alternative materials |

### Expected Value Calculation

Assume:
- P(positive) = 20% (speculative physics)
- V(positive) = $10M (technology value + citations + follow-on funding)
- V(null) = $100K (publication + constraints)

| Pathway | E[Value] | Cost | Net E[Value] |

## Recommendation

### Primary Pathway: Magnon Electrodynamics

1. **Immediate action:** Pursue $200K magnon experiment
2. **Timeline:** 6 months to first data
3. **Funding:** Seek single-PI grant or seed funding
4. **Team:** 1-2 researchers with FMR experience

### Secondary Pathway: Superconducting Qubits

1. **Conditional:** Only if magnons show positive signal
2. **Purpose:** Technology development, not proof of principle
3. **Timeline:** Begin planning after magnon Phase 1
4. **Funding:** Pursue center-scale funding with preliminary magnon data

### Rationale

> "Test the physics cheaply first. Scale the technology only after validation."

The coherence field hypothesis is speculative. Investing $2M+ before any experimental signal is high-risk. Magnon Electrodynamics allows the hypothesis to be tested at 10% of the cost in 25% of the time.

If magnons work → qubits will too (same physics)
If magnons fail → saved $1.8M

**The rational strategy is Magnon Electrodynamics first.**
